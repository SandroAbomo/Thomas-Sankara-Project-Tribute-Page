            <li>
              <span>1949</span>
              <p>Born in Yako, French Upper Volta.</p>
            </li>

              <p>
                Sankara was sent for officer training in Madagascar, where he
                witnessed a popular uprising of students and workers that
                succeeded in toppling Madagascar's government.
              </p>
            </li>

              <span>1972</span>
              <p>
                Returms to Upper Volta. Then, he attended a parachute academy in
                France, where he was further exposed to left-wing political
                ideologies.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1974</span>
              <p>
                He earned much public attention for his heroic performance in
                the border war with Mali, but years later he would renounce the
                war as useless and unjust.

                Burkina Faso was being rocked by a series of labour union
                strikes and military coups. Sankara's military achievements and
                charismatic leadership style made him a popular choice for
                political appointments, but his personal and political integrity
                put him at odds with the leadership of the successive military
                governments that came to power, leading to his arrest on several
                occasions.

              <p>
                (January) Sankara was selected as the prime minister of the
                newly formed Council for the Salvation of the People (Conseil de
                Salut du Peuple; CSP), headed by Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo. This
                post provided him with an entryway into international politics
                and a chance to meet with leaders of the nonaligned movement,
                including Fidel Castro (Cuba), Samora Machel (Mozambique), and
                Maurice Bishop (Grenada).

              <span>1983</span>
              <p>
                (May) Sankara's anti-imperialist stance and grassroots
                popularity increasingly put him at odds with conservative
                elements within the CSP, including President Ouédraogo. Sankara
                was removed as prime minister and arrested once again.

            <li>
              <span>1983</span>
              <p>
                (August) Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's close friend and fellow army
                colleague, led a group that freed Sankara, overthrew the
                Ouédraogo regime, and formed the National Council of the
                Revolution (Conseil National de la Révolution) with Sankara as
                its president.
              </p>

              <span>1987</span>
              <p>
                Sankara was assassinated in a coup led by Compaoré and two
                others, and Compaoré went on to rule Burkina Faso.

          "Imperialism is a system of exploitation that does not only manifest
          itself in the brutal form of those who come with weapons to conquer
          territories. Imperialism often occurs in more subtle forms, a loan,
          blackmail of food aid."
